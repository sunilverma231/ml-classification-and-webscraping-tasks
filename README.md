# Machine Learning Classification & Web Scraping Projects

This repository includes hands-on projects focused on **machine learning classification techniques** and a practical **web scraping assignment**. These tasks demonstrate the application of algorithms such as Decision Trees and SVMs on real-world datasets, as well as data acquisition from the web.

## 📂 Included Projects

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier on Diabetic Dataset
Trained a decision tree model to classify diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients using healthcare features. Involves data preprocessing, visualization of decision rules, and evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 2. Kernel Trick with SVM
Implemented the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel. Demonstrates how kernel tricks help handle non-linearly separable data for better classification.

### 3. Final Assignment – Web Scraping
Used Python’s `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to extract structured data from an unstructured web page. Covers handling HTML tags, navigating DOM trees, and saving extracted information to a DataFrame or CSV.
